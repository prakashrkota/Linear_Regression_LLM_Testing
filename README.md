This repository contains the supporting files for the article on

There are 3 Jupyter Notebooks that run Python code to test Linear Regression using Gradient Descent using popular LLMs.
- 1a_chatGPT_LM.ipynb
- 1b_googleAIStudio_LM.ipynb
- 1c_microsoftCopilot_LM.ipynb

To run these Notebooks the Python environment should have the Numpy, Scikit-learn and Pandas packages installed.

The Notenooks also need the /data/houses99.txt data file.  The default folder for houses99.txt is the /data location, which
is 1 folder down the root folder where the Notebook files reside.  Alternatively, you can put it in another folder and modify the
file locaion in the Notebook Python code.
